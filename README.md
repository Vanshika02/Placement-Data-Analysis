Data Analysis of the Placement Dataset.Finding the best algorithm for model creation using Machine Learning and determining the accuracy using confusion matrix.



The project includes data creation,data extraction,data exploration,feature selection,classifier accuracy using various techniques like graphs,matrics and maps.Furthermore,each feature of the data was studied and analysis were made using various algorithms used in Machine Learning. Each feature was explored and determind to know how does it affects the student in getting a placement in the university.



Models that were used to explore the obtained dataset were:



1.KNN Algorithm - (96% accuracy) The k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a simple, supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used to solve both classification and regression problems.



2.Logistic Regression-(88% accuracy)



3.Random Forest Classifier- (79% accuracy) Random forest classifier creates a set of decision trees from randomly selected subset of training set. It then aggregates the votes from different decision trees to decide the final class of the test object.



4.Support Vector Machine -A support vector machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning model that uses classification algorithms for two-group classification problems.



5.Cross Validation-(47% accuracy) It is mainly used for the comparison of different models. For each model, you may get the average generalization error on the k validation sets. Then you will be able to choose the model with the lowest average generation error as your optimal model.
